<li> Warm up before exercise. Stretch your quadriceps and hamstrings before and after exercise. </li>
<li> Try low-impact exercises. Instead of tennis or running, give swimming or bicycling a shot. Or mix low-impact exercises with high-impact exercises to give your knees a break. </li>
<li> Lose weight. </li>
<li> Walk down hills. Running puts extra force on your knee. Instead of running down an incline, walk. </li>
<li> Stick to paved surfaces. Rough roads or pocked walkways may be hazardous to your kneeâ€™s health. Stick to smooth, paved surfaces like a track or walking arena. </li>
<li> Get support. Shoe inserts can help treat foot or gait problems that may be contributing to knee pain. </li>
<li> Replace your running shoes frequently to ensure they still have proper support and cushioning. </li>
